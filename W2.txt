What we plan to do


This week we plan to get a basic version of the game working. From our user stories we plan to make specific smart tasks that we will use in our scrum sprints. 


We plan to have several meetings this week to get a good start on the project. 


We also plan on using scrum as our working strategy. 


We are going to discuss the use of version control and the workflow we are going to use in git.




What we have done


We started our first sprint.


We have created a basic UML-diagram based on our user stories. Everyone participated and we had several discussions regarding different angles of object oriented programming. 


Generated the framework for the project with the libGDX setup app. 


Divided several user stories into tasks. We later began working on some tasks which resulted in a very early version of the game. We have currently not finished any tasks.


We have also had several meetings both in person and online.  


We have created guidelines regarding the use of git. Some of these are that we will only push working code and work on branches.
