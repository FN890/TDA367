What we plan to do

This week we plan to get a "box-car" version of the game done.

We will create and work on the Vehicle that the Player will control.

We plan to work on the physics and learn and understand how they work in LibGDX.

We also want to make a base-version of powerups.

There is also a plan to clean some of the code we currently have.

What we have done

We have created a very "box-car"-like version of the game.

The first version of the Vehicle is done although some problems with joints but still learning.

Powerups now spawn in the world although they currently do nothing but act as a static body in the world.

Some code has been cleaned and packages have been moved around.
